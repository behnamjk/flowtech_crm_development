Branching: Each new feature or bug fix is developed in its own branch, allowing for isolated changes without affecting the main codebase.

Pull Requests: Developers create pull requests to propose changes, which are then reviewed and discussed by the team.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automated testing and deployment pipelines ensure that only high-quality code is merged into the main branch.

Version Control: Git is used to track changes, enabling rollback if necessary and maintaining a detailed history of the projectâ€™s evolution.

FlowTech CRM is continuously evolving, with regular updates and new features based on user feedback and market trends. This approach ensures that the software remains relevant and effective in meeting the dynamic needs of modern businesses.
